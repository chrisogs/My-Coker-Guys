<h1> This is a tribute to my classmates and friends at Coker Secondary School</h1>
<p> This is my first project as a programmer and I am dedicating it to my guys from Coker. The following is a list of these incredible guys:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ukpai 'Slyflow' Nnachi</li>
    <li>Adekunle 'Garba Lawal' Adegbenle</li>
    <li>Rasheed 'Adjamosi' Alao</li>
    <li>Ernest 'One Love' Nwalor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ukpai 'Slyflow' Nnachi</h2>

<p>Ukpai, or Sylvester, as he likes to go by, was known by me before we even gained admission into secondary school. Although we weren't friends or anything close, I was surprised when I met him at Coker and soon afterwards, we became friends. We shared a lot in common, including our love for football. 'Slyflow' wasn't exactly a stable fan in the sense that he never really supported any one team for long, but he was a fine striker. He scored lots of goals and I was happy because I was also his coach and helped him improve. But then he decied he wanted to play like Maradona, he abandoned his scoring duties and that was the end of his playing career.</p>

<h2>Adekunle 'Garba Lawal' Adegbenle</h2>

<p>Also known as 'Adex' or 'Gbenle', Adekunle was mostly refered to as Garba Lawal by most of us because of his left foot while playing football. Interestingly, he is right-handed but is left-footed! Although a smart guy, I knew football wasn't for him because his major interests were women and music. He was the king of our clique when it came to women and he never hid from a 'woman challenge'. He and I were first adversaries, because we had the same love interest in JSS1, a pretty, light-skinned young girl named 'Maria'. But you know as they say, 'bros over hoes', he and I grew closer and became friends. We even worked together briefly after we left Coker. Till date, his favourite hobby remains...women</p>

<h2>Rasheed 'Adjamosi' Alao</h2>
<img src="https://scontent-los2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/30706243_2085723374790630_1792857402484195328_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_eui2=AeGYa0W8hxgI43b6PyDKHGs8ql-xLFMlK8uqX7EsUyUry5qw5P1N2m2bPyDZOddvxXYQs052gv39Y4yXDqOee-cD&_nc_ohc=1Lo4iN0nf4gAX8bYzRq&_nc_ht=scontent-los2-1.xx&oh=52211902dfef90a91124a444204ee718&oe=60E57937"</img>
<p>Rasheed got the nickname 'Adjamosi' in 2004. His obsession with a Beninoise player of the same name saw us rechristen him after his beloved Adjamosi. 'Adja', as we also called him, was a fine football player. In fact, he was the best player in our midst and usually gave us game highlights when many of us didn't have access to satellite TV. Born and raised in Orile, 'Adja' was a key component of our clique.</p>

    <h2>Ernest 'One Love' Nwalor</h2>
    <p>Ernest was the 'ajebur' amongst us. Fresh boy with zero troubles, Ernest walked and talked like a rich man's kid. Nicknamed 'One Love' as a moniker of his surname, I often wondered what he was doing amonsgt us because I thought he should be in a private school. But that said, Ernest was a loveable member of our group and was a great artist. He was often too shy and never really went after the numerous girls who liked him.</p>
